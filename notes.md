VIM NOTE: To replace each "nil" with "Cell.new", v for Visual Mode, select the range of "nil"s
to be replaced, then enter :, :'<,'>' pops up, and then enter "s/nil/Cell.new/g" so that the
command line looks like :'<,'>'s/nil/Cell.new/g
or
:'<,'>'s/<to be replaced>/<replace with>/g

What do 's' and 'g' stand for/mean?
